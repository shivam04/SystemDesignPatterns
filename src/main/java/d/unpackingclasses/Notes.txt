what do we know so far?
1. The WeatherData class has getter methods for three measurement values: temperature,
humidity, and barometric pressure.
getTemperature()
getHumidity()
getPressure()
2. The measurementsChanged() method is called any time new weather measurement
data is available. (We don’t know or care how this method is called; we just know that
it is.)
measurementsChanged()
3. We need to implement three display elements that use the weather data: a current
conditions display, a statistics display, and a forecast display. These displays must be
updated each time WeatherData has new measurements.
4. The system must be expandable — other developers can create new custom display
elements and users can add or remove as many display elements as they want to the
application. Currently, we know about only the initial three display types (current
conditions, statistics, and forecast).
