Command object encapsulates a request by binding together a set of actions on a specific receiver.
To achieve this, it packages the actions and the receiver up into an object that exposes just one method, execute().
When called, execute() causes the actions to be invoked on the receiver. From the outside, no other objects really know what
actions get performed on what receiver; they just know that if they call the execute() method, their request will be serviced.
