The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state,
all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

The power of Loose Coupling
When two objects are loosely coupled, they can interact, but have very little knowledge of each other.
The Observer Pattern provides an object design where subjects and observers are loosely coupled.


Why?
1. The only thing the subject knows about an observer is that it implements a certain interface (the Observer interface).
2. We can add new observers at any time.
3. We never need to modify the subject to add new types of observers.
4. We can reuse subjects or observers independently of each other.
5. Changes to either the subject or an observer will not affect the other.


Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can
handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
