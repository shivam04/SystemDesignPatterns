1. First, we're going to define a State interface that contains a method for every action in the Gumball Machine.
2. Then we're going to implement a State class for every state of the machine.
    These classes will be responsible for the behavior of the machine when it is in the corresponding state.
3. Finally, we're going to get rid of all of our conditional code and instead delegate to the State class to do the work for us.
