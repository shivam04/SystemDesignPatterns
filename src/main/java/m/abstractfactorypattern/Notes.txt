The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Often the methods of an Abstract Factory are implemented as factory methods.

The job of an Abstract Factory is to define an interface for creating a set of products.
Each method in that interface is responsible for creating a concrete product,
and we implement a subclass of the Abstract Factory to supply those implementations.
