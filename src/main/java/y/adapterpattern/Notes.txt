① The client makes a request to the adapter by calling a method on it using the target interface.
② The adapter translates the request into one or more calls on the adaptee using the adaptee interface.
③ The client receives the results of the call and never knows there is an adapter doing the translation.


Note that the Client and Adaptee are decoupled – neither knows about the other.




The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
