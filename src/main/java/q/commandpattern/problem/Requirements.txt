The Waitressâ€™s job is to take Order Slips and invoke the orderUp() method on them.
The Waitress has it easy: take an order from the customer, continue helping customers until she makes it back to the order counter,
then invoke the orderUp() method to have the meal prepared.

The Short Order Cook has the knowledge required to prepare the meal.
The Short Order Cook is the object that really knows how to prepare meals.

Once the Waitress has invoked the orderUp() method; the Short Order Cook takes over and implements all the methods that are needed to create meals.

Waitress and the Cook are totally decoupled:
the Waitress has Order Slips that encapsulate the details of the meal;
she just calls a method on each order to get it prepared. Likewise, the Cook gets his instructions from the Order Slip;
he never needs to directly communicate with the Waitress.
