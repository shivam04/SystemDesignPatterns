A facade not only simplifies an interface, it decouples a client from a subsystem of components.
Facades and adapters may wrap multiple classes, but a facade’s intent is to simplify, while an adapter’s is to convert the interface to something different.


Facade Pattern, we create a class that simplifies and unifies a set of more complex classes that belong to some subsystem.


The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
