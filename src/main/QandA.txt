Q. Can't I just create a class in which all methods and variables are defined as static? Wouldn't that be the same as a Singleton?

A. Yes, if your class is self-contained and doesn't depend on complex initialization.
However, because of the way static initializations are handled in Java, this can get very messy, especially if multiple classes are involved.
Often this scenario can result in subtle, hard-to-find bugs involving order of initialization.
Unless there is a compelling need to implement your "singleton" this way, it is far better to stay in the object world.
