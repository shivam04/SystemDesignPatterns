1. Loosely coupled designs allow us to build flexible OO systems that can handle change because they minimize the interdependency between objects.
2. When you use new you are certainly instantiating a concrete class, so thatâ€™s definitely an implementation, not an interface.
3. We've learned that tying your code to a concrete class can make it more fragile and less flexible.
4. Not to call methods on objects that were returned from calling other methods!!
5. Think of a "component" as any object that is referenced by an instance variable. In other words, think of this as a HAS-A relationship.
